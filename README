File Recovery System 

Jace Rinder 

Overview: 
 This project is designed to parse disk images formatted in FAT12. Its output represents the files stored in a specified image, including 
 recoverable files that may have been deleted. 
 
How to use: 
 To compile the project using the 'Makefile' the user can simply run 'make'. This generates the executable 'fileRecovery' which can then be 
 ran alongside a specified disk image and output directory. In the repository, there is an example image entitled 'simple.img' which contains 
 two text files and two .jpg images for testing. 
 
Example: 
 $ make
 $ ./fileRecovery simple.img /recovered_files
 
 Note that in this instance the output of all recovered files will be stored in the local directory 'recovered_files'
